This is a very simple discord bot that takes all the messages in a channel and makes a bingo card out of it.
My friends wanted to create a 2020 bingo and I didn't want to manually create bingo cards. 
You can either set up the bot yourself or use this link to invite it into your server.
This bot now handles University of Toledo Covid Tracking as well.

It does need permission to send messages, read messages, attach files, and delete messages. 

Known issues: The bot will try to use pictures as part of the bingoBoard. While this doesn't crash it, the space itself will be left blank.

Commands: !bingoBoard - creates and uploads a bingo board and then deletes itself 2 minutes later.
          !UTCovid - returns total number of reported covid-19 cases on the University of Toledo campus.
